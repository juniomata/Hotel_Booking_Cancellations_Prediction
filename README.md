# Hotel Booking Cancellations Prediction

__In the hospitality industry, demand forecast accuracy is highly impacted by booking cancellations__, which makes demand management decisions difficult and risky. In attempting to minimize losses, hotels tend to implement restrictive cancellation policies and employ overbooking tactics, which, in turn, reduce the number of bookings and reduce revenue as well as impacting hotel reputation.

__By identifying which bookings are likely to be cancelled, revenue managers and other members of the hotel’s staff can take actions to avoid potential cancellations__ such as offering services, room upgrades, discounts, entrances to shows/amusement parks, or other perks. Knowledge of cancellation behaviour is relevant not only to hotel managers’ predictions of future revenues and capacity utilisation, but to their cancellation and pricing policies, as well.

According to [Antonio, de Almeida, and Nunes (2017)]('https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8260781'), guests contacted by hotels, even without being offered nothing substantial, cancel much less than guests not contacted. So, the knowledge of cancellation can help hoteliers reduce the number of people to be contacted and with that, contribute to lower cancellation rates, at controlled costs.

The data used in this project contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by [Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191). The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for [#TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md).
